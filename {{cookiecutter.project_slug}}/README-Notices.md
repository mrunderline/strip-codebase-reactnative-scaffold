# Strip code scaffold
to create a code base repo, you should have this files in scaffold repo:
 - dynamic_variables.json
 - .travis.yml

codes and tests will be dynamic with `dynamic_variables.json` content.
`.travs.yml` is a simple file for travis integration. we need travis webhook for check submission rules and scoring method, so **don't change last line**
